# 📊 Data Analytics Case Studies – Python Portfolio

## Overview

This repository is a curated collection of **data analytics case studies** where I apply Python to solve real-world problems across health, finance, and time series domains.

Each project demonstrates a full data workflow — from **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, to **modeling**, **visualization**, and **insight communication**.  
The goal is not just to show technical skill, but to tell meaningful stories with data that support decision-making.

## 🔍 Featured Projects

### **[Heart Attack Risk Classification](./general/heart_attack_rate/)**

📌 In this project, I analyze a dataset of patient health indicators to identify factors contributing to heart attack risk and build a predictive **logistic regression model**.

Key highlights:

- Cleaning and transforming medical data (age, cholesterol, ECG results, etc.)
- Exploratory data analysis (heatmaps, boxplots, feature distributions)
- Fitting and interpreting a logistic regression classifier
- Evaluating model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve
- Communicating actionable health insights for risk reduction

### **[Efficient Frontier Portfolio Optimization](./finance/4_efficient_frontier/)**

📌 A comprehensive financial case study focused on **portfolio construction** and **risk-return modeling** using historical market data.

Key highlights:

- Building diversified portfolios using daily asset returns
- Modeling tradeoffs with the **Efficient Frontier**
- Calculating and comparing Sharpe ratios, volatility, and returns
- Communicating investment strategy insights to non-technical audiences
