## üîç Featured Projects

### **[Bank Customer Churn Model Prediction](./finance/bank_customer_churn/analysis.ipynb)**

üìå In this project, I analyze bank customer data to predict churn using advanced **Random Forest classification** with hyperparameter tuning and comprehensive model validation achieving 97% ROC AUC.

- Model comparison across Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and SVM
- Hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV with multi-metric evaluation
- Learning curve analysis demonstrating excellent generalization with minimal overfitting

### **[Heart Attack Risk Classification](./general/heart_attack_rate/analysis.ipynb)**

üìå In this project, I analyze a dataset of patient health indicators to identify factors contributing to heart attack risk and build a predictive **logistic regression model**.

- Exploratory data analysis (heatmaps, boxplots, feature distributions)
- Fitting and interpreting a logistic regression classifier
- Evaluating model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve
