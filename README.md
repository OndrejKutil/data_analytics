# Data Analytics Case Studies – Python Portfolio

> This repository is a curated collection of **data analytics** case studies

## Featured Projects

### **[Real Estate Price Prediction with Scraping](./src/ML_models/real_estate_market/)**

End‑to‑end pipeline that scrapes listings from Sreality.cz, engineers features from structured data and descriptions, and trains a tuned **XGBoost regressor** to predict prices.

- Async scraping with batching and robust JSON/HTML parsing
- Feature engineering from text (amenities/POIs), areas, location, condition
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) with RMSE/R² and feature importance
- Will implement a simple web-page for interaction with the model

---

### **[Sentiment Analysis](./src/ML_models/sentiment_analysis/)**

Text classification with both a fine‑tuned **BERT** model and an **LSTM** baseline to compare modern transformers against recurrent architectures.

- Data preprocessing and tokenization; reproducible training pipeline
- Class imbalance handling and regularization where relevant
- Evaluation with accuracy, F1, ROC‑AUC, confusion matrix
- Side‑by‑side comparison of BERT vs LSTM performance and trade‑offs
