# 📊 Data Analytics Case Studies – Python Portfolio

## Overview

This repository is a collection of case studies where I apply **data analytics techniques** to real-world datasets, with a focus on **finance, investment, and time series analysis**.

Each project demonstrates the full data workflow — from **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, to **modeling**, **visualization**, and **communication of insights**.  
The goal is not just to build technical skill, but to tell a story with data that drives understanding and decision-making.

## 🔍 Sample Case Study

### **[Efficient Frontier Portfolio Optimization](./4_efficient_frontier/)**

📌 This is my most developed and comprehensive case study.  
It demonstrates how to:

- Construct portfolios using historical return data  
- Model the risk-return tradeoff using the **Efficient Frontier**  
- Visualize Sharpe ratios, volatility, and returns  
- Interpret and communicate results to non-technical stakeholders
